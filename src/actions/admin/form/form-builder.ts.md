## 1. `checkFormStatus(eventId: string)` <a name="1-checkformstatuseventid-string"></a>

This function determines whether a form associated with a given event ID is currently open.  It considers closing criteria based on time constraints and maximum submission limits (although the implementation of these criteria is not shown in the provided code snippet).

**Function Signature:**

```typescript
export function checkFormStatus(eventId: string): { isOpen: boolean } 
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type    | Description                                      |
|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `eventId` | `string` | The unique identifier of the event.             |

**Return Value:**

An object with a single property:

| Property | Type    | Description                                          |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `isOpen` | `boolean` | `true` if the form is open; `false` otherwise.     |


**Algorithm:**

The provided code snippet only shows a simplified version of the function.  The full implementation would likely include logic to check:

1. **Time-based closure:**  Compare the current time against a predetermined closing time for the event.
2. **Maximum submissions:** Check the number of submissions received for the event against a defined maximum.

If either of these conditions is met, the function should return `{ isOpen: false }`.  Otherwise, it returns `{ isOpen: true }`.  The current implementation directly returns `{ isOpen: true }`, indicating a placeholder or simplified version without the actual closing logic.  The `console.log` statement suggests debugging or logging functionality that would likely be removed or modified in a production environment.


## 2. `canGenerateTicket(registration: any)` <a name="2-cangenerateticketregistration-any"></a>

This function acts as a failsafe to prevent ticket generation unless a registration is approved.

**Function Signature (from comments):**

```typescript
export function canGenerateTicket(registration: any): boolean
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter    | Type    | Description                                    |
|--------------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| `registration` | `any`   | An object containing registration information. |


**Return Value:**

A boolean value indicating whether ticket generation is permitted:

* `true`: If the registration is approved (`registration.is_approved === true`).
* `false`: Otherwise.


**Algorithm:**

The function directly checks the `is_approved` property of the `registration` object.  This is a simple conditional check; if the property is `true`, the function returns `true`, allowing ticket generation.  If it is `false` or the property is missing, it returns `false`, preventing ticket generation. This ensures that only approved registrations can proceed to ticket generation.  The use of `any` as the type for `registration` suggests a lack of type safety and should be refactored with a more specific type definition for better maintainability and readability.
